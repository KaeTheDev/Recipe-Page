## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup  
- SCSS for styling  
- Flexbox  
- CSS Grid  
- Mobile-first workflow  

### What I learned

This project seemed simple at first glance, but handling SCSS turned out to be a real challenge. Getting the numbers and bullet points to appear correctly after styles were overridden required extra effort. I learned how to better troubleshoot CSS inheritance and specificity issues while ensuring that default list styles remained intact.

I used common resources for HTML and CSS to troubleshoot and refine my approach.

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to focus more on:  
- Improving my understanding of SCSS mixins and functions  
- Handling style overrides more efficiently  
- Enhancing accessibility in styling choices  

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - For understanding CSS specificity and counter styles.  
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - Provided insights on handling list styles effectively.
